# Snake Game
Python based Snake Game with an interactive GUI for a visually engaging experience.

(i). Abstract :- This project is a classic Snake game developed using Python's Tkinter library. Players control a snake on a grid, guiding it to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The game features smooth controls via arrow keys, popups for instructions and game results, and a dynamic score display. It delivers a nostalgic gaming experience with a focus on user-friendly design and responsive gameplay.

(ii). Instructions :- To play the Snake game, start by following the hint popup, which instructs you to use the arrow keys for movement. Control the snake using the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys to guide it toward the red food, helping it grow and increase your score. Be careful to avoid collisions with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body, as this will end the game. After a game over, a popup will appear offering the choice to replay or exit.
