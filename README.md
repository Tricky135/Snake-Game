# Snake Game
Python based Snake Game with interactive GUI for a visually engaging experience.

This project is a python based mini-game with a built-in interactive GUI for a seamless experience. The player needs to use the arrow keys to guide the snake and collect the food which makes the snake grow gradually. If you hit the walls of the game board or the snake's body with its head then the game is over. The packages used in this game are "tkinter" for making the game interface and various message boxes, and "random" to randomly spawn the food for the snake on the game board.
